# # 01: Syntax and Variables Exercises
# 
# These exercises should help you become more familiar with Python syntax and variables generally.

# ## 1: Character Input
# 
# 1. Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and age (think about how you will format these - two separate input variables for instance) and returns a message with their name and age.
# 2. Print a message that tells the user the year in which they will turn 100 years old.

# ## Ex. 2: Odd or Even?
# 
# 1. Get a number from the user.
# 2. Determine whether the number is odd or even and then print an appropriate message (hint: use the operator `%` - remainder).
# 
# __Extras:__
# 
# 3. Print another message if the number is a multiple of four.
# 4. Ask the user for two numbers (instead of just one):
#     * One number to check, other to divide by the number to check.
#     * If the first divides evenly into the second, tell the user. Otherwise, print another appropriate message.
