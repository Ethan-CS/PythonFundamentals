You can think of a function as a block of code that runs together whenever we call its name. We can pass variables/data to functions to use and these pieces of information are called _parameters._ A function can do things and return nothing or return something, which could be any data type (string, number, boolean, list, ...)."

This means that yuou can loop through data to reach a result while keeping your code pretty simple and lightweight.\n",

    "As with loops, recursion takes us close to the edge of infinite loops, so you should always think through recursive code and ensure that it will always break somewhere. In the below example, we define a function that calls itself. This function uses a variable `k` as the data, which decreases by 1 each time we recurse. Then, the recursion ends when the condition reaches 0. As I mentioned, this is a very tricky concept so try and understand this example by playing around and changing values, but don't spend too long looking at it. Come back later and try again if you don't get it straight away, and better yet try the exercises on recursion in the accompanying exercises notebook."
