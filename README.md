# PythonFundamentals

## How to use me

This repository contains a number of directories covering some of the fundamentals of coding in Python. These directories contain Jupyter Notebooks - one for the topic notes, one for the exercises and one for the solutions (plus an HTML version of the topic notes, which can be used if GitHub won't load the notebooks correctlty). I'd recommend doing the following:
* Download this repo in its entirety as a zip file
* Extract the zip file somewhere sensible (e.g. Documents folder)
* Get Anaconda [here](https://www.anaconda.com/) so you can open and edit Jupyter Notebooks. 
    * You can edit the code in the notes, play around with values and so on to get a feel for how the code works. The notebooks open in a web browser, but they are locally hosted (you don't even need to be connected to the internet to use them, you just view and edit on a web browser).
    * You should add your own code in the exercises notebooks for each exercise _before_ looking at the provided solutions!

It might be a good idea to save the exercise files that you work on elsewhere, as you may have to replace the folder you downloaded with an updated one in future that contains more material (or fixes any mistakes I made in this first pass).
