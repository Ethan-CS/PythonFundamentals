# # 02: Numbers and Strings Exercises
# 
# These exercises are to help you become more familar working with numbers and strings in Python.


# ## Ex. 1: Guessing Game
# 
# 1. Generate a random number between 1 and 10.
# 2. Ask the user to guess the number and tell them whether they guessed too high/low or guessed the number.
# 3. Keep the game going until the user guesses the number or types `exit` (hint: `while True:`
# 4. Keep track of how many guesses the user takes and when the game ends, print this to the console.

# ## Ex. 2: String List
# 
# 1. Ask the user for a string (this can be anything) and print whether the string is a palindrome or not.

# ## Ex. 3: Rock, Paper, Scissors
# 
# 1. Make a two-player rock-paper-scissors game.
# 
# Hint: ask for each player to input a play, compare, print a message of congratulations to the winner and ask if they want to start a new game. Remember: rock > scissors > paper > rock.

# ## Ex. 4: Fibonacci
# 
# 1. Write a program that asks the user how many Fibonacci numbers to generate and then generate that many.
# 2. Try and use functions to complete this task.
# 
# Hint: the Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers where the next number is the sum of the previous two. It begins at 1, then 1 again, then 1+1=2 so the next number is 2, 2+1=3 so then we move to 3, then 5, etc. so we have 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...

# ## Ex. 5: Reverse word
# 
# 1. Write a program (with functions) that gets a long string containing multiple words from the user.
# 2. Print the same string back to the user with the _words_ in the _reverse order._ For instance, "My name is Ethan" becomes"Ethan is name My".

# ## Ex. 6: Password generator
# 
# 1. Write a program that generates passwords. Be creative - use a mix of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers and symbols. 
# 2. Make sure passwords are random and a new one is generated each time you run the program.

# ## Ex. 7: Check for Primality
# 
# Every good prime number generator starts with code that can check whether a given number is prime or not (so it knows which numbers to output and which to ignore).
# 
# 1. Ask the user for a number and determine whether it is prime or not.
# 2. To do this, you might write code that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the numbers that divide evenly into that number (e.g. 18/9 gives a whole number, so 9 is a divisor of 18 and it would be printed). 
# 3. Recall that a prime number's only divisors are 1 and itself - you can then perform a logical test to see whether this is true of a given number, thereby seeing if it is prime or not.
