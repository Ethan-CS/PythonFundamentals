# 1. Create a class named `Vehicle`.
#     * Give the class attributes `max_speed` and `mileage`.
#     * Instantiate an object `car` with:
#         * `max_speed` of 120,
#         * `mileage` of 10,000
#     * Print these attributes _via an object reference._

# 2. Create a child class `Bus` that:
#     * Inherits all of the variables and methods of the Vehicle class,
#     * Has another attribute: `capacity`, representing the number of people a bus object can seat.
#     * Make the `capacity` attribute have a default value of 60.
#     * Instantiate an object `megabus` with:
#         * Top speed 100,
#         * Mileage 100,000 and
#         * Capacty 80.
#     * Print these attributes _via an object reference._
#     * Print the _type_ of the `megabus` object (hint: use the `type()` method)
#     * Find out whether `megabus` is an instance of the parent `Vehicle` class (hint: use the `isinstance()` method)
